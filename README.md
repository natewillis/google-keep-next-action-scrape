# Google Keep Next Action Scraper
This code scrapes all google keep notes which are not archived and have the label "!Next actions".  It takes this data and stores it in a json file.  I'm utilizing this json for sending daily task e-mails to my work e-mail.  This project utilizes python-decouple to protect against posting password data to github.
